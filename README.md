cfml-manifesto
==============

The CFML Manifesto is a living document of suggested practices for the CFML language. This repository contains all the source files for building the manifesto website, http://cfmlmanifesto.com.

## Contributing

Contributions are most welcome (and indeed necessary). You can contribute by:

* Raising issues in the GitHub issue tracker for any suggestions for improvement, new content and / or content amends.
* Forking the repo, making amends and submitting a pull request

### I want to amend / write some content, where are all the files?

The source files for the website can all be found in the `gh-pages` branch of the repository. Fork and clone the repo to your machine and then switch to the `gh-pages` branch to edit locally. Or, you can switch to the `gh-pages` branch in your browser and edit files directly if that works for you.
